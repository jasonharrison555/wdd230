            <p class="walmart2"> Walmart's website uses a lot of repition. One
                 of the things they do is have circles with images of products 
                 in them. Walmart also shows repition by using the same colors. 
                They like to use the colors blue, white and yellow. Those colors
                 appear in many places.  </p>

            <p class="amazon1"> 
             Amazon uses the principle of alignment quite a bit in their website. 
             One of the things they do is horizontally align their buttons and navigation 
             bars. They also like to align their pictures together. They also aligned the
             search and sign bars with the pictures that are below.  
            </p>

            <h4>Anytime Fitness</h4>
            <a href="https://www.anytimefitness.com/">https://www.anytimefitness.com/</a>
            <div><img class="amazonimg"
            src="images/anytime.jpg" alt="anytime fitness webpage screenshot image" ></div>
            <p class="anytime"> Anytime Fitness uses a lot of contrast in their website.
                If you look at their fonts, they aren't all the same. They'll use a bolder font 
                and below it use a skinnier font. Another example of contrast that they use are
                the color they use. They used a darker purple for the background and made the font
                white. When the background was white they used purple for the font color.   </p>
