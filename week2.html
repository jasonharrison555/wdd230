            <p class="amazon1"> I think that Amazon's website shows alignment because there are 
            several pictures and buttons that align with each other. The pictures
            at the bottom of the page line up with each other. They also align with 
            the picture above it. The "sign in" button also aligns with the picture
            below it. </p>

            <p class="walmart2"> I think that Walmart's website shows a lot of repition. They
                use a lot of circles with images inside of them. Another way 
                they use repition is that they use a lot of the same colors. 
                They use a lot of blue, white and yellow. The blue and yellow 
                repeats in the circles. The blue also repeats in the blue bar 
                at the top. </p>

            <p class="jayde1"> Jayde Mikenzie Photography uses a lot of contrast in their website.
                For instance their fonts aren't all the same. They have a sort of 
                plainer font on top and then on the bottom have a more fun looking 
                font. This creates some contrast. They are also using black font on 
                a white background. </p>
