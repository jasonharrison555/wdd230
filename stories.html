        <h2>The Hike</h2>

<P class="story">I could feel the sweat dripping down my back from carrying my backpack up the 
beautiful Teton mountains for the last 9 and a half miles. Chills were going 
down my spine from the slight wind that was blowing in my face. The sky was 
cloudy, with rays of sunshine peeking through the clouds coming and going like
a gentle wave. We finally made it to the top of the mountain where we can set 
up camp. The view was amazing. The sun was ready to set, making a beautiful 
orange-pink color. We started setting up camp since the sun was setting, which 
meant we didn’t have much time till it was dark. After we set up the camp we 
got out our portable stove and started to boil some water for our cup of noodles. 
It was quiet here. You couldn’t hear any man made sounds. Only the beautiful sounds
 of the soft, cool breeze sweeping through the mountains. We finished eating 
 our food quickly so that we could hang all of our food up in the trees before
  it was too dark to see. When we finished doing that, we came back to our camp 
  and we talked for a while in the dark as we watched the flickering of the flames
   from the fire. Exhausted, my Dad said, “Alright well we have to walk down the 
   mountain tomorrow so lets get to bed.” My Brother and I nodded in agreement. 
   We headed to the tent and got inside our warm, cozy sleeping bags. “Daniel” , 
   My dad said. “If you need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, wake
    me or your brother up to go take you. Okay?” he said with a stern tone. “Okay 
    Dad, I will.” “Promise?” “I Promise dad.” “Okay, because I don’t want you getting
     lost.” ”Okay, okay” I say with a slightly annoyed tone in my voice. I then lay on
    my back and before I know it, I’m out. In the middle of the night I woke up to a 
    loud snorting noise. It was my Dad’s snoring. Since I was up I had that nagging 
    urge to go to the bathroom. I decided not to try to go back to sleep because then 
    I’d have that sleep whiplash where I’m in and out of sleep all night, each time 
    thinking about how I need to go. I got up out of the tent. With my Dad and Brother
     sleeping soundly I felt bad waking them up to go so I decided to go by myself. I 
     wouldn’t go far. With my flashlight in hand, I went off to find the closest tree 
     which was at least 100 yards away. The flashlight was kind of dim because I had 
     forgot to replace the batteries but it got me to where I wanted to go. When I got
      to the tree, I heard a shuffling of branches and leaves on the ground. Concerned,
       I whipped my flashlight around to see what was there. I shined the light around 
       the area I heard the sound and that’s when I saw a pair of yellow lights. Only I
        realized that those weren’t lights. They were actually a pair of yellow gleaming
        eyes. Looking a little closer, I noticed the unmistakable mask on it’s face.
        “Hisssssss!” I yelled and ran in the opposite direction not even thinking about
        what direction my tent was.I didn’t stop running for about 2mins. I slowed down 
        to a stop. Moved my flashlight around to make sure there was nothing else around.
        To my relief, there wasn’t. Then it dawned on me. I had no idea where I was. To
        make matters worse, my light started flickering and went out. 
	Now I was in complete darkness. The only light I could see was from the brilliant stars
     in the sky. Around me I could only see the outlines of darkened trees and rocks. The dam
    that was holding the fear in, suddenly broke and began to rush through me like river rapids.
     I started to shake and curl up into a ball. My eyes started to well up with tears and started
      to sob. I was lost. Nobody knew where I was and there were unseen animals lurking around me in
       the shadows. I decided to press my head into my knees because whenever I looked around I would 
       imagine creatures moving around in the darkness. I wish I had just gotten my Dad up like he told
        me. When I thought all hope was lost, I saw a flicker of light be chased by the shadows.I lifted
         up my head and to my utter relief, I saw a moving white light in the distance. It was 
         almost blinding because I had been in the dark for so long. There was a short dark figure,
          behind the light. It was my brother! I sprang up from the ground and started to run towards
           the light. When I got to him, I thought he was going to chastise me for breaking the promise
            I made with Dad, but instead he lovingly embraced me with his arms. The hug began to burn
             the worry, anxiety, fear and shame away. With curiousty I asked, “How did you know where
              I was?”. “I heard you zipping up the tent and when I realized Dad was still in the tent,
               I decided to get up and follow you to make sure you got back alright. Good thing I did 
               because you might have been out here all night if I hadn’t. Come on I lead you back to
                the tent. ”  When we got back to the tent I got into my sleeping bag and fell back asleep.</P>
